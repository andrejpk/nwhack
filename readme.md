Nationwide Hackathon -- Azure Field Guide
=========================================

Hackathon is June 20-21! Use this guide to help you get started quickly in Azure for the hackathon. Feel free to contact Andrej Kyselica for questions here.
This material is developed by vairous Microsoft and Nationwide team members--their contact info will be listed therein. 

First, you'll need to get access to Azure.


This guide covers some common scenarios:

- **Web sites and REST APIs (for direct use or backing for mobile apps)**: Dev tools supported: Node.js, C#, Java
- **Turn-key Big Data platform (Hadoop, Spark, Hive, etc.)**
- **Database as a service (Relational, NoSQL)**
- **Machine Learning (Azure ML Studio â€“ ML PaaS) and Cognitive services**
- **Serverless Function apps**
- **IoT: gateway, event processing, machine learning**
- **Bot framework**

If you see some missing here, please let us know! (The best way is to [post an issue](https://github.com/andrejpk/nwhack/issues) on this repo.)

Getting Access to Azure
------------------------
The Hackathon is using a separate NW Hackation Azure subscription. Your team will need to request access and get its own [Resource Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups) (admin container) in that subscription. 

*The process of requesting access to this subscription is not finalized.. more to come!*


Web sites and REST APIs (for direct use or backing for mobile apps)
------------------

If you are building a Spring/Java app or 12-factor app, please consider the Pivotal Cloud Foundation platform that's also being officially supported for the Hackathon. 

Create a Web App in App Services: 
[Node.js](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/app-service-web-get-started-nodejs)
